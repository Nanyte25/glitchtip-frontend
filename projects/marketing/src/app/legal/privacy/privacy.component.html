  Privacy Policy
</h2>

<p class="mat-body-1">
  Your privacy is critically important to us. At GlitchTip we have a few
  fundamental principles:
</p>

<ul>
  <li class="mat-body-1">
    We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
  </li>
  <li class="mat-body-1">
    We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with
    the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
  </li>
  <li class="mat-body-1">
    We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the
    on-going operation of one of our services.
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="mat-body-1">
  Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals.
</p>

<p class="mat-body-1">
  If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please
  contact us at
  <a href="mailto:privacy@mail.glitchtip.com">privacy@mail.glitchtip.com</a>.
  GlitchTip operates several websites including glitchtip.com. It is GlitchTip’s
  policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while
  operating our websites.
</p>

<h2 class="fancy mat-display-1">
  Website Visitors
</h2>

<p class="mat-body-1">
  Like most website operators, GlitchTip collects non-personally-identifying
  information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make
  available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and
  the date and time of each visitor request. GlitchTip’s purpose in collecting
  non-personally identifying information is to better understand how GlitchTip’s
  visitors use its website. From time to time, GlitchTip may release
  non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a
  report on trends in the usage of its website.
</p>

<p class="mat-body-1">
  GlitchTip also collects potentially personally-identifying information like
  Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. GlitchTip does not use such information to
  identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other
  than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
  personally-identifying information, as described below.
</p>

<h2 class="fancy mat-display-1">
  Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
</h2>

<p class="mat-body-1">
  Certain visitors to GlitchTip’s websites choose to interact with GlitchTip in
  ways that require GlitchTip to gather personally-identifying information. The
  amount and type of information that GlitchTip gathers depends on the nature of
  the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at
  app.glitchtip.com to provide an email address. Those who engage in
  transactions with GlitchTip are asked to provide additional information,
  including as necessary the personal and financial information required to
  process those transactions. In each case, GlitchTip collects such information
  only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the
  visitor’s interaction with GlitchTip. GlitchTip does not disclose
  personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors
  can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the
  caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related
  activities.
</p>

<h2 class="fancy mat-display-1">Use of personal data</h2>

<p class="mat-body-1">
  GlitchTip may collect aggregated statistics about the behavior of visitors to
  its websites. For instance, GlitchTip may monitor the most popular user
  accounts on the platform. GlitchTip may display this information publicly or
  provide it to others. In addition, GlitchTip may use your behavioral data and
  other data you provide to GlitchTip to customize internal advertisements on
  its platform to its users (for example, to offer you a premium membership).
  However, GlitchTip does not disclose personally-identifying information other
  than as described below.
</p>

<h2 class="fancy mat-display-1">
  Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
</h2>

<p class="mat-body-1">
  GlitchTip discloses potentially personally-identifying and
  personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors
  and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order
  to process it on GlitchTip’ behalf or to provide services available at
  GlitchTip’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.
  Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be
  located outside of your home country; by using GlitchTip’s websites, you
  consent to the transfer of such information to them. GlitchTip will not rent
  or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
  information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated
  organizations, as described above, GlitchTip discloses potentially
  personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when
  required to do so by law, or when GlitchTip believes in good faith that
  disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of
  GlitchTip, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user
  of an GlitchTip website and have supplied your email address, GlitchTip may
  occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your
  feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with GlitchTip and
  our products. We expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send
  us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback
  mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or
  respond to your request or to help us support other users. GlitchTip takes all
  measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use,
  alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
  personally-identifying information.
</p>

<h2 class="fancy mat-display-1">
  Cookies
</h2>

<p class="mat-body-1">
  A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s
  computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the
  visitor returns. GlitchTip uses cookies to help GlitchTip identify and track
  visitors, their usage of GlitchTip website, and their website access
  preferences. GlitchTip visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on
  their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using
  GlitchTip’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of GlitchTip’s
  websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
</p>

<h2 class="fancy mat-display-1">
  Business Transfers
</h2>

<p class="mat-body-1">
  If GlitchTip, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the
  unlikely event that GlitchTip goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user
  information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a
  third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any
  acquirer of GlitchTip may continue to use your personal information as set
  forth in this policy.
</p>

<h2 class="fancy mat-display-1">
  Privacy Policy Changes
</h2>

<p class="mat-body-1">
  Although most changes are likely to be minor, GlitchTip may change its Privacy
  Policy from time to time, and in GlitchTip’s sole discretion. GlitchTip
  encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its
  Privacy Policy.
