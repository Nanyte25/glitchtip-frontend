To start using GlitchTip, you will need to:

1. Install a Software Development Kit (SDK) into your project so it is able to send events to GlitchTip.
2. Configure it with a Data Source Name (DSN) so it knows where exactly to send events. You can find your DSN by clicking "Settings", then "Projects", then the project you want to set&nbsp;up.
3. Initialize the SDK to start sending events.
